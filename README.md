## Portfolio

Here are the projects I've developed as part of my portfolio!

‚≠ê [EDA + Forecasting the price of used cars:](https://github.com/karine94/EDA-Forecast.git)

  **Description:** Using a fictitious database (available in this repository), I carried out an exploratory analysis of the data to obtain insights and answer business questions. In addition, I used supervised machine learning models to predict the price of used cars from two datasets. `cars_train`: was the dataset used to train, validate and evaluate the model. `cars_test`: was the dataset used to make the predictions, with the model already running. 
  The models explored in this project were *Linear and Ensemble models (bagging and boosting)*. To evaluate the performance of the models I used some metrics such as *RMSE and R-Squared*.

‚≠ê [Predicting prices for AirBnB Buenos Aires accommodation:](https://github.com/karine94/AIRBNB-BUENOS-AIRES.git)

  **Description:** This was the first project I did in the area. Although simple, it helped me develop many skills. In this project I carried out graphical analysis, descriptive statistics, data wrangling and modeling. The models explored in this project were: multiple linear regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest. To assess the performance of the models, I used a number of metrics. 

‚≠ê [Dashboards with Power BI](https://github.com/karine94/Analise-exploratoria-rh.git)

  **Description:** This repository contains projects developed with Power BI. 

‚≠ê [SQL Projects](https://github.com/karine94/sql-projects.git)

  **Description:** This repository contains projects developed with SQL.
